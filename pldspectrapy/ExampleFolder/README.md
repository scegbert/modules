#  Example fitting folder

This is an example of a directory that you would put somewhere else on your computer, outside the group gitlab-linked directory, so you can run pldspectrapy like it's numpy but you can edit it.
I recommend you copy this example folder to somewhere else on your computer and rename it NateFitting, or whatever your name is.
Then your computer-specific scripts don't get rewritten each time you pull the latest version of pldspectrapy from gitlab.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. You might have trouble running an example folder without these packages.

```
python3.x
numpy
lmfit
hapi (local file for now)
matplotlib
scipy
seaborn
```
